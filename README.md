NOTES:

As of 23/03/2024, the dev tunnel still doesn't work, so I'm using localhost => Will have to use local images, because localhost doesn't serve images.

From 25/03/2024 To 03/04/2024, a lot of major and minor issues fixed.

On 06/04/2024 managed to fix favourite pets not loading on the FavsPage, fixed the Java.Runtime issue and the bitmap being "too large" issue.
