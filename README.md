This is a complete Pet Adoption Mobile App - You can adopt pets (maybe list pets for adoption); Sort pets by age, by view count, by gender, by breed; It contains a user JWT factory.

The data is fetched via API from a DB.

The application is made in .NET MAUI with C# and XAML



NOTES:
As of 23/03/2024, the dev tunnel still doesn't work, so I'm using localhost == Will have to use local images, because localhost doesn't serve images.
